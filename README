zstd

A Zstandard compressor tool, without dictionary support, that reads from stdin,
writes to stdout, and only takes compression level as an argument.

Example usage:
	zstd -19 < file > file.zst
	tar -c file | zstd > file.tar.zst
	curl http://www.example.com | zstd -10 > example.html.zst

Depends on libzstd.
